            <p>The CampusConnect project at ALU aims to boost student
                 engagement and accessibility of university events through 
                 a user-friendly web app. Real-time updates, simplified event
                  details, and networking opportunities will enhance the 
                  student experience, fostering a stronger community. 
                  Goals include increased engagement and participation.
                   Continuous improvements will be made during implementation.
